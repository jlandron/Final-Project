# DUSK

Dusk is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic roguelike following catastrophic events that surrounded the atmosphere in smog, bathing the Earth in darkness, seemingly leaving the land barren and devoid of life. A lone robot boots up after decades of inactivity, having no memory, being equipped only with a light and a will to survive and learn more about the events that happened.
